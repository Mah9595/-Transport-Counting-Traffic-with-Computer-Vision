# Transport Counting Traffic with Computer Vision

Tucked away quietly up high, traffic cameras take pictures steadfastly and without our notice. It’s amazing how much data on traffic is stored. It’s even more amazing how the Singapore government allows us to call an API to retrieve the images taken by these traffic cameras.

What can we do with so much image data? We could examine them using computer vision models and count the number of cars that go through one of the roads in Singapore. In this massive and ambitious end-to-end project, you will acquire 2M+ rows of tabular data, and tens of thousands of image data to count traffic volume on a Singapore highway.
